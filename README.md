# CIS7-Course-Projct
My Course Project was on the Vigenere Cipher and I had done the project alone.
  Listed below is a WORD Doc that lists my approaches and also my flowchart on how I had done the project. 
  A brief description into how the program works is:
    THe Key Generator creates the key while the algorithm for encryption, Ei = (Pi + Ki) mod 26, and the algorithm for decryption,Di = (Ei - Ki + 26) mod 26, are implemented. The date that this will be published is December 13, 2021.
